#### About me

 My IT career started in my second year at university. True, at that time it was a non-technical specialty. I studied at the Faculty of Marketing, took a special course on SEO website optimization, and got a job as a Marketer in an IT company. After that, I decided to try my hand at design. I mastered 3D modeling and tripled to work in an interior design studio. At the same time, I was interested in photography. I organized my creativity for fashion magazines and commerce. I also did retouching. At the moment, I really want to learn Frontend development and become a specialist in this field. I hope that my patience, perseverance and the ability to comprehend new information will help me achieve this goal.
